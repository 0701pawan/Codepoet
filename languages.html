                <p class="lead"><h3>Lets first talk about the <strong>powers</strong> that come with python</h3>
                    <br>
                    
                    <h4>Libraries:</h4> Python supports many built-in libraries, but wait...... what libraries are? what are
                they used for? libraries are simply the collection of functions and method which helps us to execute
                many tasks without writing code, So it helps us to simplify our programs as well as to save
                time.<br><br> Let me name some of the most common libraries which are used :<br><br>
                Request:- It is used for requesting data from a server(HTTP library)<br>
                pywin32:- This is used to interact with windows <br>
                Pillow:- This module is basically used for Imaging library<br>
                pyautogui:- This helps in pressing a button automatically<br>
                json :- This module helps in converting json data into dictionary<br>
                There are 250+ libraries in python , I have used the above libraries in python projects I kindly request
                you to have a look <a href="https://github.com/0701pawan">python projects</a>
                <br><br>
                <h4>User-friendly:</h4> Python is very user friendly launguage and it can be the first lauguage of
                anyone who want to start their career in programming as it is very easy to learn compare to other
                programming languages. The data structure like <strong>lists</strong> and <strong>dictionaries</strong>
                also help user to perfrom various types of tasks with ease.<br><br>
                <h4> Open Source and Community Development:</h4>
                Python language is developed under an OSI-approved open source license, which makes it free to use and
                distribute, including for commercial purposes.Further, its development is driven by the community which
                collaborates for its code through hosting
                conferences and mailing lists, and provides for its numerous modules
                <br><br>
               <h3> Now let's talk about <strong> responsibilities</strong></h3>
                <br>
                by responsibilities I mean what all things we can do with python programming languages
                <br> <br>
                <h4> Web development: </h4>The framework such as Flask and Django is the most in-demand technologies these
                framework helps to map the python functions to the frontend on the client request
                <br> <br>
               <h4>  AI and Machine Learning:</h4> The most famous technologies across the world are done through python
                programming because it has many built-in libraries which help and support the developers such as NumPy,
                Scikit-learn, pandas and there are a lot more.

                <br> <br>
                <h4> Game Development: </h4>Python comes with a module named as pygame which help the game developers to build 3D
                games such as flappy bird etc.
                <br> <br>
                <h4>  GUI Development:</h4> The module in python named as Tkinter which helps in building user interfaces there are
                other modules also which help in building the user interfaces such as wxWidgets, Kivy, PYQT
